# Java Exercises: Methods and Loops

This repository contains a collection of simple Java exercises focused on practising methods and loops (for, while, and do-while).

## Whatâ€™s Included
Method implementations for various basic tasks (e.g. sum, product, factorial)

Loop examples using for, while, and do-while

Practice problems aimed at improving algorithmic thinking

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to help me strengthen my understanding of Java fundamentals, particularly working with methods and control flow using loops. I will continue adding exercises as I learn more.
